Released on 2020-11-28.

#### Added
- The possibility of loading custom Events into the VideoPlayer. This can be used to play non-MCLS content in the VideoPlayer (not recommended, as it loses compatibility with other MCLS features, like annotations).
- Added errors to the VideoPlayer to clarify why certain streams are unplayable by the user (e.g. due to geoblocking).
- Added a `l10nBundle` parameter to the `Configuration` object. This can be used to provide a custom `Bundle` from which localized strings should be taken. Useful in advanced scenarios, e.g. when custom error messages should be shown, or support for non-supported languages should be added.

#### Changed
- Expose the `PlayerConfig` object directly on the VideoPlayer, so that it may be altered on the fly.
